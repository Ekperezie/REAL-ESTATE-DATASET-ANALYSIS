## OVERVIEW
I performed an analysis in EXCEL on a real estate dataset, creating a visual dashboard to highlight key trends, patterns and actionable insights. 
Real Estate Data Analytics Report

## 1. Objective
This project aimed to uncover:
A.	Geographic trends in property sales
B.	Broker performance based on revenue and volume
C.	Revenue and pricing patterns across states

## 2. Tools Used
SQL: Used for cleaning and preparing the dataset
Excel: Used for building dashboards and visualizations

## 3. Key Insights
## Geographic Trends
-	Massachusetts generated the highest total sales revenue (~$67M), followed by Rhode Island and Connecticut.
-	It also had the highest average sales revenue per property, with over $1.7M per sale, indicating a high-value market.
-	Resale activity was most frequent in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, suggesting strong property turnover.
-	Massachusetts had the highest number of active brokers, showing a dense and competitive real estate landscape.


## Broker Performance
-	There is no direct correlation between number of sales and total revenue generated by brokers.
-	Some brokers with fewer sales still ranked among the top 10 in total revenue, indicating that they handled higher-value properties.
-	For example, brokers outside the top 10 in sales count still appear in the top 10 for revenue   emphasizing that property type and value, not just volume, drive broker performance.


## Revenue & Pricing

-	Average sale prices and total revenue are highest in urbanized states with premium property markets.
-	States with more brokers tend to generate more overall revenue, but not necessarily higher average prices.


## 4. Conclusion

-	The analysis highlights that high-value properties, not high volume alone, determine a brokerâ€™s contribution to company revenue. Geographic hotspots like Massachusetts offer strong pricing and sales activity, while broker strategy should focus on targeting premium listings for optimal performance.
